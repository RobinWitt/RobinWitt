# Welcome to my profile!

My name is **Robin** and I'm based in *Leipzig*. 
My favourite activity is bouldering, which I started in 2019. But I really got sucked into it 2021 when I was watching competitions and began to train. This year I went to *Innsbruck* to watch the Boulder&Lead World Cup live. It was very inspiring to see the athletes in person.

#### If you haven't heard of bouldering yet, you might want to check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8F11DGPggs). ####

#### Here is a list of other stuff I'm into: ####
- gravelbiking
- tabletennis
- vegan food
- listening to progressive metal
- playing chess (although im bad at it)

#### This is what the Leipziger Auwald looks like: ####

There are a lot of parks, lakes and rivers, thats one thing I really like about the city.
